## About PIXEL

PIXEL is an audio-visual art project built on the Kaspa blockchain.

Instead of starting with code or static images, PIXEL begins with sound.  
Audio signals are transformed into visual forms using oscilloscope-based and signal-driven techniques, and then inscribed on Kaspa’s blockDAG as NFTs and on-chain data.

## Why Kaspa?

Kaspa’s blockDAG architecture provides fast confirmation and high parallelism.  
For PIXEL, this means a scalable, living network that can support ongoing audio-visual experiments directly on-chain.

## Collections

- **PIXELONKAS** – sound-derived pixel visuals minted as KRC-721 NFTs on Kaspa.  
- **SYKORA** – a collection inspired by Zdeněk Sýkora and linked to research for the Letenský Tunnel chimney installation in Prague, generated from audio signals and oscilloscope patterns.

## Vision

PIXEL is a long-term process:

- continuous experiments with sound → image pipelines  
- new collections and collaborations  
- pushing more of the creative process directly on-chain  

Collectors support the project and help expand audio-visual art within the Kaspa ecosystem.
